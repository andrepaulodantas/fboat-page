        <p>
        According to the Rio de Janeiro State Institute for the Environment (INEA-RJ), the growing pressure on water resources, in addition to the increase and diversity of sources of pollution, makes monitoring changes in water quality increasingly required. This monitoring is done to support protection and recovery actions, aiming to guarantee current and future uses. The data from the monitoring are the basis for the assessment of water quality and for the production of reports, diagnoses and bulletins on the conditions of the water bodies.</p>

        <p>In order to collaborate in addressing this environmental demand, a group of researchers from the Universidade Federal Fluminense stands out by bringing more technology to the process of monitoring the quality of water resources in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Students and faculty from the Departments of Electrical Engineering (TEE-UFF), Water Resources and Environment Engineering (TGH-UFF), and the Institute of Computing (IC-UFF), are jointly developing an autonomous vessel for monitoring water from bays and lagoons of Niterói. The initiative also has financial support from the Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) and has a partnership with the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Niterói City Hall, the Brazilian Navy and the NVIDIA, a world leader in Artificial Intelligence solutions and high-performance embedded computing systems.</p>
